\noindent User authentication is an important step to protect information and in this field face biometrics is advantageous. Face biometrics is natural, easy to use and less human-invasive. Unfortunately, recent work has revealed that face biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing attacks using low-tech equipments. Countermeasures have been proposed in order to mitigate this vulnerabilities. However several works in the literature present evaluations using different metrics and in private database making the comparison of countermeasures a difficult task. The main goal of this masters project is to provide a comparative study of countermeasures against face \textit{spoofing} attacks.
