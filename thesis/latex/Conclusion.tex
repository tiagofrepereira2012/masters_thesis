\chapter{Conclusion}

%As future work we will test more complex strategies of score fusion in order to improve the performance results. This Framework is flexible to aggregate not only data from different databases, but can support any kind of configuration. For example it is possible to aggregate countermeasures trained for a specific kind of attack (print attack, video attack, mobile phone attack and so on). Different configurations for the framework will be tested in the future.
